            <h1>Our Services</h1>
            <p class="fh5co-lead">Direct Rail Services (DRS) is a rail freight company in Great Britain. Created in 1994
              by British Nuclear Fuels Ltd to take over British Rail's handling of nuclear material, and in 2005
              transferred to the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, it has since diversified into other freight
              operations and providing haulage for passenger services. DRS is one of only two remaining publicly owned
              railway companies in the United Kingdom, the other being NI Railways, the passenger rail operator in
              Northern Ireland.</p>

              <h3>Passenger services</h3>
              <p>In 2007, seven former Virgin Trains Mark 3 carriages were refurbished at Oxley depot.The following year
                saw the coaches used to operate charter services under the Stobart Rail banner but the Stobart Rail
                operation ceased in July 2008</p>

              <h3>Depots</h3>
              <p>Direct Rail Services initially operated from a base at the nuclear reprocessing plant in Sellafield,
                but in 1998 moved into Carlisle Kingmoor depot which had been disused since 1987.</p>

              <h3>Fleet</h3>
              <p>The initial fleet of locomotives were five Class 20/3s which were overhauled at Brush Traction,
                Loughborough for their new duties</p>

              <h3>Electrification</h3>
              <p>The electrification system provides electrical energy to the trains, so they can operate without a
                prime mover on board. This allows lower operating costs, but requires large capital investments along
                the lines. Mainline and tram systems normally have overhead wires, which hang from poles along the line.
                Grade-separated rapid transit sometimes use a ground third rail.</p>

              <h3>Financing</h3>
              <p>The main source of income for railway companies is from ticket revenue (for passenger transport) and
                shipment fees for cargo. Discounts and monthly passes are sometimes available for frequent travellers
                (e.g. season ticket and rail pass). Freight revenue may be sold per container slot or for a whole train.
                Sometimes, the shipper owns the cars and only rents the haulage. For passenger transport, advertisement
                income can be significant.</p>

              <h3>Maintenance</h3>
              <p>As in any infrastructure asset, railways must keep up with periodic inspection and maintenance in order
                to minimize effect of infrastructure failures that can disrupt freight revenue operations and passenger
                services.</p>

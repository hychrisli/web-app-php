            <h1>Meteoric: New Era</h1>
            <p class="fh5co-lead">Rail transport is a means of transferring of passengers and goods on wheeled vehicles
              running on rails, also known as tracks. It is also commonly referred to as train transport. In contrast to
              road transport, where vehicles run on a prepared flat surface, rail vehicles (rolling stock) are
              directionally guided by the tracks on which they run. Tracks usually consist of steel rails, installed on
              ties (sleepers) and ballast, on which the rolling stock, usually fitted with metal wheels, moves. Other
              variations are also possible, such as slab track, where the rails are fastened to a concrete foundation
              resting on a prepared subsurface.</p>

              <h3>Intermodal</h3>
              <p>Intermodal freight transport involves the transportation of freight in an intermodal container or
                vehicle, using multiple modes of transportation (e.g., rail, ship, and truck), without any handling of
                the freight itself when changing modes. The method reduces cargo handling, and so improves security,
                reduces damage and loss, and allows freight to be transported faster. Reduced costs over road trucking
                is the key benefit for inter-continental use. This may be offset by reduced timings for road transport
                over shorter distances.</p>

              <p>A railroad switch (AE), turnout, or [set of] points (BE) is a mechanical installation enabling railway
                trains to be guided from one track to another, such as at a railway junction or where a spur or siding

              <h3>Automotive</h3>
              <p>A railroad car or railcar (American and Canadian English),[a] railway wagon or railway carriage
                (British English) and UIC), also called a train car or train wagon, is a vehicle used for the carrying
                of cargo or passengers on a rail transport system (a railroad/railway). Such cars, when coupled together
                and hauled by one or more locomotives, form a train. Alternatively, some passenger cars are
                self-propelled in which case they may be either single railcars or make up multiple units.</p>
